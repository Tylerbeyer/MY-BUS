I Want Web based software that I can deploy on my shared server. Namecheap.com.
I don't know a lot about this kind of development, so if there is a something unclear stop and ask for my input. also use as much free tools as possible.
I want it to also have the capability to work offline sometimes. like a PWA. or other web based-app. 
Please always comment code. and include Readme, map of datebase(s) and Fields and relations.  and Deployment instructions with each new section. 

Please start with a step by step plan and then start making new code, always update the plan and strike threw completed items as we go.
  
Build the front-end-gui pages, then the backend and front end connections. make each gui to be super user friendly, and easy customizable. put General display color and fonts in a Global Location to share across sections. 

I want to do all testing on the server. 

Build in the Master admin account for me to get started. Make the Title and Naming easy to change for NEW deployments across different company's Domains. maybe like Global settings for Deployment and  all in one place.
